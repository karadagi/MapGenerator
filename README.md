    This tool procedurally generates images of city maps. The process can be automated, or controlled at each stage give you finer control over the output. 3D models of generated cities can be downloaded as a `.stl`. The download is a `zip` containing multiple `.stl` files for different components of the map. Images of generated cities can be downloaded as a `.png` or an `.svg`. There are a few choices for drawing style, ranging from colour themes similar to Google or Apple maps, to a hand-drawn sketch.
